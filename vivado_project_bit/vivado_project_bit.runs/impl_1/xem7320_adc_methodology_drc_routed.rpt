Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-24#1 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
An asynchronous set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 39 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks adc_data_clk and mmcm0_clk0 overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 44). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints

An asynchronous set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 39 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks mmcm0_clk0 and adc_data_clk overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 42).
